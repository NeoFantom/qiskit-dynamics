    "In this tutorial we will walk through the simulation of a two-transmon\n",
    "system using the high level `.systems` modelling module.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Define the model for the system as the summation of two transmon\n",
    "    models with an exchange interaction.\n",
    "2.  Construct a `.DressedBasis` object storing the dressed basis for the\n",
    "    model.\n",
    "3.  Simulate the time evolution under driving of one of the transmons,\n",
    "    starting in the ground state.\n",
    "4.  Restrict the `.DressedBasis` to the computational subspace, and plot\n",
    "    the populations of the computational states as a function of time\n",
    "    under the above time evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we set JAX to work in 64 bit mode on CPU.\n",

    "\n",
