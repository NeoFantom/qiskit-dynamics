    "the qubit. We begin by creating a pulse schedule with a `sx` gate\n",
    "followed by a phase shift on the drive so that the following pulse\n",
    "creates a `sy` rotation. Therefore, if the qubit begins in the ground\n",
    "state we expect that this second pulse will not have any effect on the\n",

    "2.  Converting pulse schedules to a `.Signal`.\n",
    "3.  Create the system model, configured to simulate pulse schedules.\n",
    "4.  Simulate the pulse schedule using the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create the pulse schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use the pulse module in Qiskit to create a pulse schedule.\n",

    "## 2. Convert the pulse schedule to a `.Signal`\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit Dynamics has functionality for converting pulse schedule to\n",
    "instances of `.Signal`. This is done using the pulse instruction to\n",
    "signal converter `.InstructionToSignals`. This converter needs to know\n",
    "the sample rate of the arbitrary waveform generators creating the\n",
    "signals, i.e. `dt`, as well as the carrier frequency of the signals,\n",
    "i.e. `w`. The plot below shows the envelopes and the signals resulting\n",
    "from this conversion. The dashed line shows the time at which the\n",
    "virtual `Z` gate is applied.\n",

    "## 3. Create the system model\n",
